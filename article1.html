									<h1>Competence or Confidence ?</h1>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<h2></h2>
								<p>
                                    If you have ever followed Chess , you would know that Magnus Carlsen has has never lost many game.
                                    He says in one of his interview , that at any given day or game its always good to be overconfident , overstimate
                                    yourself than to feel the opposite. Many a times we have also seen people say 'fake it till you make it' or "who Cares". 

                                    Why is it so? Is it because everyone who makes it has been competent enough? Yes , but if it were not for their 
                                    confidence , would they have made it ?No. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In everything that we do , in every sphere of life if you see its not 
                                    always the one who is the most intelligent , or the one who is the most hardworking who has made it big. 
                                    It has always been the peope who have allowed failures , who are self-assured , maybe
                                    delusional,who dont care and have the attitude "whats there to lose" , who have succeeded. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Therefore if we think that "we dont know", "we cant do it ", "there are people better than us", "its impossible", 
                                    then 'ITS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN' even if we have put countless number of hours of hardwork to be as competent as the 
                                    other person out there.
                                    The problem has never been of competence actually , its always about confidence. The right attitude. It doesnt mean that 
                                    with all the confidence or the right attitude we will never fail. We might . More than others. But atleast we would not 
                                    live with the regret of "Not trying" or "not giving it a shot"

                                </p>                                    
.

                                 <p>
                                    No one can tell you ,"you are good". It is you who believes you are the "BEST". It is you who says 'I can do it' even if 
                                    the other person standing opposite has 100 more achievements compared to you. Its the  confidence that helps you make 
                                    it in life.

                                    If there is anything that stops you from achieving anything ,its your belief in that. Just that belief that you can do it 
                                    is all that matters. You are more skilled than you know. 
                                <p>
                                    You are more talented than you know . You are more knowledgable than 
                                    you think are. You are more than anything and everything if you believe it that way. 
                                    So before you decide to leave an opportunity , or miss that small chance that could change your life just because you 
                                    were not competent enough, just remember they are 1000 other people worse than you who are killing it just because they 
                                    "thought they could."
